<h1>wine 11 avaliable just donwload it!<h1/>
  <h4>Attention I've added libstdc++6 to the folder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, if you download wine 10.0 and face some issue e.g. the app doesn't spawn or work, just unpack the app and delete this libs from this folder<h4/>
    * [Latest Stable Release](https://github.com/lucasmz1/wine_appimage/releases/tag/continuous-stable)
<br>if you face audio issues like audio craking or noise do this "export PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60", this is not a problem of my build, this is a well known wine issue.<br/>
